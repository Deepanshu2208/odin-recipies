<h1 class="recipe_title"> Naan Recipe</h1>
     
    <p class="intro">This homemade naan recipe makes soft, chewy naan with a buttery taste. It is the best I have tasted outside of an Indian restaurant. Simply delicious eaten warm brushed with melted butter or served with your favorite curry.</p>

    <h3 class="ingredients_title">Ingredients:</h3>
    <ul class="ingredients_list">
        <li>1 (.25 ounce) package active dry yeast</li>
        <li>1 cup warm water</li>
        <li>¼ cup white sugar</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons milk</li>
        <li>1 large egg, beaten</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons salt</li>
        <li>4 ½ cups bread flour</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons minced garlic (Optional)</li>
        <li>¼ cup butter, melted</li>
      </ul>
      
<h3 class="directions_title">Directions</h3>
    <ol class="directions_list">
        <li>Dissolve yeast in warm water in a large bowl. Let stand about 10 minutes, until frothy.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, generously oil a large bowl.</li>
        <li>Stir sugar, milk, egg, and salt into the yeast mixture. Mix in enough flour to make a soft dough.</li>
        <li>Knead dough on a lightly floured surface until smooth, 6 to 8 minutes.</li>
        <li>Place dough in the prepared oil, cover with a damp cloth, and let rise until doubled in size, about 1 hour.</li>
        <li>Punch down dough on a lightly floured surface, and knead in garlic. Pinch off small handfuls of dough about the size of a golf ball; you should have about 14. Roll each piece into a ball and place on a tray. Cover with a towel, and allow to rise until doubled in size, about 30 minutes.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, preheat a large grill pan over high heat.</li>
        <li>Roll each piece of dough into a thin circle.</li>
        <li>Brush some melted butter on the preheated grill pan. Place a few pieces of dough in the pan (as many as you can fit) and cook until puffy and lightly browned, 2 to 3 minutes. Brush butter onto the uncooked sides, flip, and cook until browned, 2 to 4 more minutes. Remove from the grill and repeat to cook the remaining naan.</li>
    </ol>
